# Personal Portfolio

My personal portfolio profile page. Hosted on [aidan.contact](https://aidan.contact/) using Node.js and Google Cloud services. The application is comprised of two sides: a web version of my resume and a visual showcase of my work.

### Local Development

Use the following commands to install the dependencies and start the server. Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
