# Personal Portfolio

My personal portfolio profile page. Built with Next.js and hosted on [aidan.contact](https://aidan.contact/) using the Google Cloud platform. The application contains a visual showcase of my work using content dynamically rendered with React and fetched from [aidan.contact/api](https://aidan.contact/api), a simple JSON REST API built using Mongoose and MongoDB on the back end.

### Local Development

Use the following commands to install the dependencies and start the server. Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Alternatively, you can use the following to more closely simulate the web deployment process.

```
rm -r .next
npm run build
npm start
```
